#### Executing shared counter
```bash
$ g++ <program-name>.cpp -std=c++17 -o <program-name> && <program-name>

# it might not work in powershell, so use the command prompt instead
# you could also execute first the command before '&&' and then the command after the '&&'

# Choose the amount of threads (n) and how many increments you want each thread to do (m)
# Both integers

```

#### Executing buffer
